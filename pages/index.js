								spirit of TED’s overall mission to research and discover{' '}
								<Word>“Ideas Worth Spreading”</Word>. TEDx brings the spirit of
								TED to local communities around the globe through TEDx events.

								events include live speakers and recorded TED Talks, and are
								organized independently under a free license granted by TED.

								agree to abide by our format, and are offered guidelines for
								curation, speaker coaching, event organizing and more. They
								learn from us and from each other. More than 3000 events are now
								held annually.{' '}
